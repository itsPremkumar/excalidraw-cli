## What it does

Drawing diagrams by hand is slow and not version-controllable. Excalidraw Diagram CLI solves this: Generate Excalidraw diagrams — flowcharts, sequences, architecture — as valid .excalidraw JSON.

**Best for:** Engineers documenting architecture, agents generating diagrams, and tech writers.

## Features

- **Generate a flowchart**
- **Build a sequence diagram**
- **Compose an architecture map**
- **Merge/overlay diagrams**
- **Export valid Excalidraw JSON**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/excalidraw-cli/main/excalidraw_cli.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python excalidraw_cli.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python excalidraw_cli.py diagram --help   # diagram subcommand
python excalidraw_cli.py merge --help   # merge subcommand
python excalidraw_cli.py info --help   # info subcommand
python excalidraw_cli.py export --help   # export subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Generate a flowchart
1. Build a sequence diagram
1. Compose an architecture map
1. Merge/overlay diagrams
1. Export valid Excalidraw JSON

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| Drag-drop in Excalidraw | Diagrams as code, diff-able in git. |
| Mermaid only | Native Excalidraw JSON, hand-drawn style. |
| Screenshots | Regenerate from text anytime. |
